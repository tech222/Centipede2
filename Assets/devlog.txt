turn only on Flag == true
turn on keydown and on key
comments
organize (functions?)
include seg's gameobjects in Head (1 player gameobject)
collision cube at corners, ontrue == turn

todo:
maze
enemy
frogs
eggs (spawn to new player/enemy)
hud
gui


frog:
have frog hone in on egg. vector between frog and egg. weight frog move direction based on egg location.

6-26 todo:
add trailing segments to enemy and baby
destroy baby at home and increment player
have frog hone in on egg
frog-egg collider
head-enemy collider
enemy-head collider
rotate gameobject to consistent plane (xy or xz?)


6-28:
seg trailing idea?
set seg[] = position if(timer%a)==0, a=5?6? where timer += Time.time.
use fixedupdate for constant framerate?

if segAmt > array.length then increase array size
if segAmt < array.length then decrease array size
(start with array ~10)?

frogmove using 4 raycasts from above at N,E,W,S

segs bunch up at slow speed, stretch out at high speed:
set positions[i] index skip to a ratio of speed to keep distance between segs constant.

trigger with head covers entire snake (all child segments):
use raycast for head hit to isolate head from segments *or*
put control script in empty and make head and segs children

On Frog, Player, and Enemy - try gameObject.setActive(false)/(true) instead of Destroy/Instantiate.

7-9:
enemy & frog AI/homing (include 4-way X intersections)
enemy baby

7-16:
for maze bigger than screen, alpha channel fade on edges where maze reaches outside of camera view.

gui - wood/swamp theme?

7-27:
if player is bigger than enemy then flip enemy aggressiveness to have enemy move away from player and vice versa.
use x & y-axis inputs so as to allow for joystick

7-30:
have 1 sprite for enemy and fade color from orange to yellow using fade method and sprite renderer (no animation component)

Commonly, it is good practice to put your User Interface on a different layer, then render it by itself with a separate Camera set to render the UI layer by itself.

8-14:
3 different enemies? each enemy type gives birth to it's own type.
change gate open/close to animations?
add dumb/randomAI to enemies and balance.

8-24:
fix frog spawning in locations
fix player snake wall collisoins on returning home after finishing level
add random AI for enemies and balance aggresiveness in inspector
make SceneManager into singleton to preserve score, players between scenes
Use Player Prefs to save score? highscore system?

8-26:
replace gate move coroutines with unity animations?
